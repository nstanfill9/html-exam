            <br> <a>The <i>iPhone 4S</i> was the fifth iPhone that Apple released, despite its name. The iPhone 1 was first, followed by two different models of the iPhone 3, and then two different models of the iPhone 4. The iPhone 4S was the better model. It was announced on October 4th, 2011. This day is extremely important because on the following day, October 5, 2011, the co-founder of Apple, Steve Jobs, passed away. Jobs died from health complications with cancer. Jobs was crucial in the foundation of the iPhone, so the tech world was very upset to learn of his passing. Customers could place orders for these phones on October 7. This model of iPhone is considered one of the revolutionary models of Apple cell phones in the short time they have been around. The <i>iPhone 4s</i> was the first iPhone with Siri. Siri is a voice activated personal assistant that helps the user perform tasks that they would normally have to do manually. With the use of Siri, users could search the web, open apps, and even send text messages and emails! Not only did customers have their own personal assistant in their pocket, but the camera on this model of iPhone was considered to be the best smartphone camera to date. The <i>iPhone 4S</i> was vital to the technology that we have in our phones now. In today's society, Siri is just seen as a common feature inlcuded in all iPhones. Back in 2011, the idea was revolutionary.</a>
