            <br> <a> <i>Project Purple</i> was a top secret project intended to create a small, personal computer operated by a human finger. Apple wanted to create a device that allowed users to have a small enough device they could carry in their pocket without using a stylus or other third party device. You always have a finger available. Project Purple actually began to compete with a similar system developed by Microsoft, except their system did not use your fingers. Instead, their touch screen devices were powered by a third party stylus that had to be brought everywhere the device was in order to use it. Another goal for Apple was to create a device that was a cell phone and an iPod. Apple was selling iPods left and right, but they knew that the future was a device that combined phone and music. Most people at the time were carrying an iPod for their favorite music and a phone to talk to people. Apple brought other major tech inventors to the team to help with the revolutionary product. The project was kept secret to ensure the integrity of the iPhone. This was going to change in the near future, as Apple developed a device that changed the world. </a>
