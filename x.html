            <br> <a>The <i>iPhone X</i> was released on November 3, 2017. The X name was given to the iPhone to represent the roman numeral 10. This model can either be called the <i>iPhone X</i> or the iPhone 10. This iPhone was the first time that Apple strayed away from the traditional design of the iPhone. All Apple phones in the past inlcuded bevels above and below the interactive screen. They also had a home button below the screen that allowed users to go back to the home screen on their phone. The new design created a bevel-free display, making the screen much bigger than previous models without actually making the phone size bigger. Instead of the traditional home buttom below the screen, users could now swipe up from the bottom of the screen to return to home. One major critisism of the <i>iPhone X</i> was the notch at the top of the screen. The notch was included to have a place for the front facing camera and screen sensors. Users said that the notch took away from the bevel free display. Many third party apps, who were designing apps around the previous versions of the iPhone, complained that the new technology would not work correctly with their apps. Many apps on the new iPhone had a bad display because of the new type of screen. While there were some complaints and critisisms, the <i>iPhone X</i> was a revolutionary design that allowed the iPhone to be where it is today, with the iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max.</a>
