            <br> <a>The <i>iPhone 12 Pro</i> series includes the smaller, less powerful <i>iPhone 12 Pro</i> , and the bigger <i>iPhone 12 Pro Max</i> . These two phones are the latest in the iPhone line from Apple. The smaller of the two phones was released on October 23, 2020 while the bigger Pro model was released on November 13, 2020. One of the biggest features included in the 2020 line of phones is 5G capability. 5G is the newest type of cellular data connection. It is faster than 4G, but not many phones on the market were able to support it. Apple changed this with the release of the <i>iPhone 12 Pro</i> . Another feature is the camera on the newest phones. The camera is actually comprised of three seperate lenses fused together to make professional looking pictures. With the new camera, photos are enhanced over other smartphone cameras on the market. Some users even reported professional-like pictures taken from the <i>iPhone 12 Pro</i> . The display is another upgrade over all the other iPhones on the market. While the Pro model is about the same size at the 11 series, the Pro Max model, which is the best phone that Apple currently makes, features a 6.7 inch display, which is the biggest iPhone screen to date! For comparison, the iPad Mini has a screen size of 7.9, so the iPhone is only about an inch behind! Many people think that the 6.7 inch model is simply too big for a pocket or a purse, while others think that it is a happy medium between a cell phone and an iPad. The <i>iPhone 12 Pro</i> is the best iPhone that money can buy, but that will soon change in September or October of 2021.</a>
