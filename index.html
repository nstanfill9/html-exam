                    <br> <a> <i>Project Purple</i> was a top secret project intended to create a small, personal computer operated by a human finger. Apple wanted to create a device that allowed users to have a small enough device they could carry in their pocket without using a stylus or other third party device. You always have a finger available. Project Purple actually began to compete with a similar system developed by Microsoft, except their system did not use your fingers. Instead, their touch screen devices were powered by a third party stylus that had to be brought everywhere the device was in order to use it. Another goal for Apple was to create a device that was a cell phone and an iPod. Apple was selling iPods left and right, but they knew that the future was a device that combined phone and music. Most people at the time were carrying an iPod for their favorite music and a phone to talk to people. Apple brought other major tech inventors to the team to help with the revolutionary product. The project was kept secret to ensure the integrity of the iPhone. This was going to change in the near future, as Apple developed a device that changed the world. </a>

                    <br> <a>The <i>Original iPhone</i> , or iPhone, was hyped up for almost a month before its release. According to a survey, 60% of Americans knew of the release before the phone was actually made public. Off duty police were hired to protect stores as people lined up to get their shiny new device. On June 29, 2007, Apple released the first generation of iPhone. For the 4 GB model, the price was $499, and if you wanted more storage, you could opt for the 8 GB model which ran for $599. Most stores said that they sold out within the first hour of opening. To purchase an iPhone, the customer had to sign a two year contract with AT&T for service. At the time, Apple did not offer the unlocked version of the iPhone, which would work with any carrier. This caused outcry for people with other service providers, so this changed in the future. Also, the first iPhone was working on the iPhone OS 1, which was the first iPhone operating system. In this software, users could of course talk on the phone, use voicemail, write and receive e-Mails, and browse the web using Apple's browser, Safari. Text messaging was also utilied on the iPhone along with other apps, such as YouTube, maps, and Google maps. Other basic cell phone features were included, but the iPhone changed how people saw computers. Before the iPhone, to browse the web, you had to find a big computer with WiFi. Now, you could search anything from your pocket!</a>
