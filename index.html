                    <br> <a> <i>Project Purple</i> was a top secret project intended to create a small, personal computer operated by a human finger. Apple wanted to create a device that allowed users to have a small enough device they could carry in their pocket without using a stylus or other third party device. You always have a finger available. Project Purple actually began to compete with a similar system developed by Microsoft, except their system did not use your fingers. Instead, their touch screen devices were powered by a third party stylus that had to be brought everywhere the device was in order to use it. Another goal for Apple was to create a device that was a cell phone and an iPod. Apple was selling iPods left and right, but they knew that the future was a device that combined phone and music. Most people at the time were carrying an iPod for their favorite music and a phone to talk to people. Apple brought other major tech inventors to the team to help with the revolutionary product. The project was kept secret to ensure the integrity of the iPhone. This was going to change in the near future, as Apple developed a device that changed the world. </a>

                    <br> <a>The <i>Original iPhone</i> , or iPhone, was hyped up for almost a month before its release. According to a survey, 60% of Americans knew of the release before the phone was actually made public. Off duty police were hired to protect stores as people lined up to get their shiny new device. On June 29, 2007, Apple released the first generation of iPhone. For the 4 GB model, the price was $499, and if you wanted more storage, you could opt for the 8 GB model which ran for $599. Most stores said that they sold out within the first hour of opening. To purchase an iPhone, the customer had to sign a two year contract with AT&T for service. At the time, Apple did not offer the unlocked version of the iPhone, which would work with any carrier. This caused outcry for people with other service providers, so this changed in the future. Also, the first iPhone was working on the iPhone OS 1, which was the first iPhone operating system. In this software, users could of course talk on the phone, use voicemail, write and receive e-Mails, and browse the web using Apple's browser, Safari. Text messaging was also utilied on the iPhone along with other apps, such as YouTube, maps, and Google maps. Other basic cell phone features were included, but the iPhone changed how people saw computers. Before the iPhone, to browse the web, you had to find a big computer with WiFi. Now, you could search anything from your pocket!</a>
                
                <li> <h3>iPhone 4S</h3> </li>

                    <br> <a>The <i>iPhone 4S</i> was the fifth iPhone that Apple released, despite its name. The iPhone 1 was first, followed by two different models of the iPhone 3, and then two different models of the iPhone 4. The iPhone 4S was the better model. It was announced on October 4th, 2011. This day is extremely important because on the following day, October 5, 2011, the co-founder of Apple, Steve Jobs, passed away. Jobs died from health complications with cancer. Jobs was crucial in the foundation of the iPhone, so the tech world was very upset to learn of his passing. Customers could place orders for these phones on October 7. This model of iPhone is considered one of the revolutionary models of Apple cell phones in the short time they have been around. The <i>iPhone 4s</i> was the first iPhone with Siri. Siri is a voice activated personal assistant that helps the user perform tasks that they would normally have to do manually. With the use of Siri, users could search the web, open apps, and even send text messages and emails! Not only did customers have their own personal assistant in their pocket, but the camera on this model of iPhone was considered to be the best smartphone camera to date. The <i>iPhone 4S</i> was vital to the technology that we have in our phones now. In today's society, Siri is just seen as a common feature inlcuded in all iPhones. Back in 2011, the idea was revolutionary.</a>

                    <br> <a>The <i>iPhone X</i> was released on November 3, 2017. The X name was given to the iPhone to represent the roman numeral 10. This model can either be called the <i>iPhone X</i> or the iPhone 10. This iPhone was the first time that Apple strayed away from the traditional design of the iPhone. All Apple phones in the past inlcuded bevels above and below the interactive screen. They also had a home button below the screen that allowed users to go back to the home screen on their phone. The new design created a bevel-free display, making the screen much bigger than previous models without actually making the phone size bigger. Instead of the traditional home buttom below the screen, users could now swipe up from the bottom of the screen to return to home. One major critisism of the <i>iPhone X</i> was the notch at the top of the screen. The notch was included to have a place for the front facing camera and screen sensors. Users said that the notch took away from the bevel free display. Many third party apps, who were designing apps around the previous versions of the iPhone, complained that the new technology would not work correctly with their apps. Many apps on the new iPhone had a bad display because of the new type of screen. While there were some complaints and critisisms, the <i>iPhone X</i> was a revolutionary design that allowed the iPhone to be where it is today, with the iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max.</a>

                <li> <h3>iPhone 12 Pro</h3> </li>

                        <img src="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/images/product/iphone/standard/Apple_announce-iphone12pro_10132020_big.jpg.large.jpg">
                    <br> <a>The <i>iPhone 12 Pro</i> series includes the smaller, less powerful <i>iPhone 12 Pro</i> , and the bigger <i>iPhone 12 Pro Max</i> . These two phones are the latest in the iPhone line from Apple. The smaller of the two phones was released on October 23, 2020 while the bigger Pro model was released on November 13, 2020. One of the biggest features included in the 2020 line of phones is 5G capability. 5G is the newest type of cellular data connection. It is faster than 4G, but not many phones on the market were able to support it. Apple changed this with the release of the <i>iPhone 12 Pro</i> . Another feature is the camera on the newest phones. The camera is actually comprised of three seperate lenses fused together to make professional looking pictures. With the new camera, photos are enhanced over other smartphone cameras on the market. Some users even reported professional-like pictures taken from the <i>iPhone 12 Pro</i> . The display is another upgrade over all the other iPhones on the market. While the Pro model is about the same size at the 11 series, the Pro Max model, which is the best phone that Apple currently makes, features a 6.7 inch display, which is the biggest iPhone screen to date! For comparison, the iPad Mini has a screen size of 7.9, so the iPhone is only about an inch behind! Many people think that the 6.7 inch model is simply too big for a pocket or a purse, while others think that it is a happy medium between a cell phone and an iPad. The <i>iPhone 12 Pro</i> is the best iPhone that money can buy, but that will soon change in September or October of 2021.</a>
